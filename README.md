# Topological-Data-Analysis-on-Time-Series-Data
Persistent homology on music coverted to time series data, built to analyze how an artist's music may evolve over time.
Uses a sliding window transformation with 1-dimensional persistence scoring to discover periodicity/structure in the time series data.
